# recursion
This project's goal is to create two Ruby methods using recursion. One method creates an array of length *n* numbers in the [Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence) and the other sorts a given array utilizing the [merge sort algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort).

This project was created as an exercise for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-recursion).
